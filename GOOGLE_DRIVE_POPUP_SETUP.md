# Google Drive Popup Authentication Setup

## 🔧 **No Additional Google Cloud Console Configuration Needed!**

Great news! We're using the **same callback URL** that's already registered in your Google Cloud Console. No additional setup required!

### **How It Works**

The popup flow uses the existing callback URL (`/api/auth/google-drive/callback`) but detects when it's called from a popup using a special `state` parameter. This means:

- ✅ **No new URLs to add** to Google Cloud Console
- ✅ **Uses existing redirect URI** that's already registered
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with regular authentication flow

## 🚀 **How the Popup Flow Works**

1. **Click "Connect Google Drive"** → Opens popup window
2. **Complete OAuth in popup** → Google redirects to existing callback
3. **Callback detects popup** → Returns HTML page instead of redirect
4. **Popup stores tokens** → Sends success message to parent window
5. **Parent window receives message** → Updates UI and loads files
6. **Popup closes automatically** → You're back to the main file manager

## 🔍 **Benefits of Popup Flow**

- ✅ **No page redirects** - Stay on the file manager page
- ✅ **Better UX** - No 404 errors or lost state
- ✅ **Cleaner flow** - Popup handles OAuth, main page stays intact
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Popup closes after successful auth

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

If popups are blocked:
1. **Allow popups** for your localhost domain
2. **Check browser settings** for popup blockers
3. **Try a different browser** if issues persist

The popup will show a nice loading screen while processing the authentication!
